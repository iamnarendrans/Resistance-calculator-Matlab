In this distribution .zip file, there are 5 Matlab files:
- resistor_code.fig
- resistor_code.m
- init_bands.m
- update_color.m
- update-value.m

and 12 .jpg files, one for each color on a regular resistor.

Place all the files in the same directory.
Make those files available from within Matlab, and on your command window type: resistor_code

These files have been tested only with Matlab 7.0.1 for Windows XP.
I cannot guarantee that they work under any other platform...
